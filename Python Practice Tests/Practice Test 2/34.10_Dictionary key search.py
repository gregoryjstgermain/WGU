Create a solution that accepts an integer input identifying how many shares of stock are to be purchased
from the Old Town Stock Exchange, followed by an equivalent number of string inputs representing the
stock selections. The following dictionary stock lists available stock selections as the key with the
cost per selection as the value.

stocks = {'TSLA': 912.86 , 'BBBY': 24.84, 'AAPL': 174.26, 'SOFI': 6.92, 'KIRK': 8.72, 'AURA': 22.12,
'AMZN': 141.28, 'EMBK': 12.29, 'LVLU': 2.33}

Output the total cost of the purchased shares of stock to two decimal places.

The solution output should be in the format

Total price: $cost_of_stocks

Sample Input/Output:

If the input is
