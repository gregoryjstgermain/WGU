"""
Create a solution that accepts any three integer inputs representing the base (b1, b2) and height (h)
measurements of a trapezoid in meters. Output the exact area of the trapezoid in square meters as a float
value. The exact area of a trapezoid can be calculated by finding the average of the two base measurements,
then multiplying by the height measurement.

Trapezoid Area Formula:
A = [(b1 + b2) / 2] * h

The solution output should be in the format

Trapezoid area: area_value square meters

Sample Input/Output:

If the input is

3
4
5

then the expected output is

Trapezoid area: 17.5 square meters

Alternatively, if the input is

3
5
7

then the expected output is

Trapezoid area: 28.0 square meters
