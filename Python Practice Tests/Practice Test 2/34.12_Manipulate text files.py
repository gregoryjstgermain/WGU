"""
Create a solution that accepts an input identifying the name of a text file, for example, "WordTextFile1.txt".
Each text file contains three rows with one word per row. Using the open() function and write() and read()
methods, interact with the input text file to write a new sentence string composed of the three existing
words to the end of the file contents on a new line. Output the new file contents.

The solution output should be in the format

word1
word2
word3

Sample Input/Output:

If the input is

WordTextFile1.txt

then the expected output is

cat
