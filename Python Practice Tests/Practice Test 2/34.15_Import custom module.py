"""
Create a solution that accepts an integer input representing the age of a pig. Import the existing module pigAge
and use its pre-built pigAge_converter() function to calculate the human equivalent age of a pig. A year in a
pig's life is equivalent to five years in a human's life. Output the human-equivalent age of the pig.

The solution output should be in the format

input_pig_age is converted_pig_age in human years

Sample Input/Output:

If the input is

8

then the expected output is

8 is 40 in human years
