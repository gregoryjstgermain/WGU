"""
An acronym is a word formed from the initial letters of words in a set phrase.
Write a program whose input is a phrase and whose output is an acronym of the input.
Append a period (.) after each letter in the acronym. If a word begins with a lower case letter,
don't include that letter in the acronym. Assume the input has at least one upper case letter.

Ex: If the input is:

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers

the output is:

I.E.E.E.

Ex: If the input is:

Association for computing MACHINERY

the output is:

A.M.

The letters ACHINERY in MACHINERY don't start a word, so those letters are omitted.

Hint: Use isupper() to check if a letter is upper case.
