"""
Implement the quadratic_formula() function. The function takes 3 arguments, a, b, and c, and computes the
two results of the quadratic formula.

The quadratic_formula() function returns the tuple (x1, x2). Ex: When a = 1, b = -5, and c = 6,
quadratic_formula() returns (3, 2).

Code provided in main.py reads a single input line containing values for a, b, and c,
separated by spaces. Each input is converted to a float and passed to the quadratic_formula() function.

Ex: If the input is:

2 -3 -77

the output is:

Solutions to 2x^2 + -3x + -77 = 0
x1 = 7
x2 = -5.50
